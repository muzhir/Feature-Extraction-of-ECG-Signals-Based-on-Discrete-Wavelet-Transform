# Feature-Extraction-of-ECG-Signals-Based-on-Discrete-Wavelet-Transform
Electrocardiographic (ECG) signal is a recording of the cardiac activities, which is usually used by cardiologists to obtain information about the performance of heart function. ECG signals are very important in medical diseases diagnosis and there is a big problem in accurate decision for this subject. This work aims to reconstruct ECG signals and to detect the deflection of these signals corresponding to the ideal signals and then give a prognosis alarm to solve the appear problems. The proposed approach including; preprocessing, feature extraction using DWT then decision making based on the certain threshold.
